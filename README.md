# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
### Customer churn ,customer turnover or customer defection is the loss of clients or customers.
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.
Our ultimate goal is to find models/methods which gives us best predicton for the telecom churn.
